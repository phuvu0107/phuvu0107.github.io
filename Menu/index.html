                    <h4>Spring Roll<span>$6.5</span></h4>
                    <p>These fresh Vietnamese spring rolls are made with shrimp, 
                    vegetables, herbs, and rice noodles wrapped in rice paper. 
                    Vietnamese spring rolls are traditionally served with nước chấm 
                    (a dip made of fish sauce), but they’re great with peanut sauce as well.</p>

                    <p>These Vietnamese egg rolls are made with pork, and nicely 
                    balanced out with veggies, mung bean thread, and mushrooms. 
                    And when you use the right wrappers they come out golden brown, 
                    and irresistibly crispy. The typical way to eat these is wrapped 
                    with green leaf lettuce, herbs and dipped into fish dipping sauce of course!</p>

                    <p>Nem Nuong Cuon or Nem Nuong Nha Trang is a spring roll appetizer that appears in many Vietnamese 
                    restaurants. These spring rolls are made with rice paper and filled with Vietnamese 
                    grilled / baked pork sausage, lettuce, assorted herbs, a crunchy component made 
                    from either fried rice paper wrapper or egg roll wrapper and comes with its signature orange dipping sauce on the side.</p>

                    <p>Banh beo is made simply: powdered rice soak into water for several minutes to have liquid. 
                    Then, mix with a little grease and pour into small cups. 
                    Enjoying banh beo properly is in each small cup, 
                    not in the bowl or plate as some restaurant, hotels.</p>

                    <p>Vietnamese rice paper salad (Banh Trang Tron) is what Andrew Zimmern describes as “Vietnam in a bag.” 
                    This street food is what I like to call a hodge-podge salad. 
                    It’s a popular street food in Southern Vietnam, particularly Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
